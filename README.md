## task-manager (wip)

Trello-like task-manager web application built with MERN stack and Socket.io (come with drag and drop lists/cards, chats,...).

> Shout out to Trello - my favorite tool, and I use it for every project I make. I want to build a web application like it but modify some stuff to fit my taste.
